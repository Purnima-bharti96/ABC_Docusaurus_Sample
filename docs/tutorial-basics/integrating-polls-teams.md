# Integrating Polls in Microsoft Teams

This document describes how to add the "Polls" feature inside Microsoft Teams for organizations to use for improving engagement and collecting feedback.

## 1. Introduction

Microsoft Teams allows users to create polls using the built-in Forms app. Polls can be very useful for team decision-making, planning events, or collecting anonymous responses.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you can add polls, make sure the following requirements are met:

- Microsoft Teams account is active
- You have permissions for adding tabs and apps
- Internet connection is working properly
- Forms app has not been removed from the Teams environment

## 3. Steps for Adding Polls

### Open Teams Desktop or Browser Version
Log into your Microsoft Teams with the correct credentials.

### Select Team and Channel
Click on the team or channel where you want to insert the poll.

### Click on "+" Sign
At the top of the channel's tabs, press the "+" to add a new tab.

### Choose Forms
Search for "Forms" in the app search and click it. If Forms doesn't appear, it may be blocked by your administrator.

### Create Poll
When the tab is added, you can select "Create a new poll" or choose an existing one. Add your questions and answer options.

### Save and Share
After setting up the poll, press "Save". The poll will be shown to all members of the channel. They can vote in real-time.

## 4. Using Polls in Meetings

- During Teams meetings, click on "..." in the toolbar
- Choose "Forms" and you can launch polls directly from there
- Participants can respond during the meeting without leaving the session

## 5. Common Issues

| Problem | Possible Reasons | Solution |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| Forms is not showing | May not be allowed by IT administrator | Contact your IT admin to enable Forms app |
| Polls not saving | Connection lost or temporary issue | Check internet connection and try again later |
| Can't see responses | Need permission or poll not submitted yet | Verify permissions or wait for responses |

## 6. Best Practices

- **Keep questions clear and concise** - Avoid ambiguous wording
- **Limit answer options** - Too many choices can overwhelm participants
- **Set appropriate permissions** - Decide if responses should be anonymous
- **Monitor responses** - Check results regularly during active polls
- **Follow up on results** - Share outcomes and next steps with the team

## 7. Advanced Features

### Poll Analytics
- View response statistics and trends
- Export results to Excel for further analysis
- Track participation rates across team members

### Integration with Other Apps
- Connect polls with Power BI for advanced reporting
- Use Microsoft Lists to track poll results over time
- Integrate with Planner for action items based on poll outcomes

## 8. Troubleshooting

### Forms App Missing
If the Forms app is not available:
1. Check with your IT administrator about app policies
2. Verify your Microsoft 365 license includes Forms
3. Try refreshing the Teams application

### Permission Issues
If you cannot create polls:
1. Ensure you have the necessary role in the team
2. Check if external apps are allowed in your organization
3. Contact your Teams administrator for assistance

## 9. Conclusion

Integrating polls is very easy and helps improve communication within teams. Make sure that the app is available and permissions are correct to use this feature effectively. Regular use of polls can help make Teams more interactive and engaging for all participants.
